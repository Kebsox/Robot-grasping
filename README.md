This tutorial aims to present how to obtain a cloud point and an RGB image

the program works.

## 1 Tools installation

You will need several different tools to compile and create the program.

1. linux 16.
2. ROS kinetic
3. Open CV
4. Librealsense
5. Realsense

### 1.1 Linux 16.

If you are a new user of Linux i suggest to follow this tutorial :http://lea-
linux.org/documentations/Installer_Ubuntu_16.04.
YoucanalsoworkwithUbuntu14butyouwillneedtoadaptsomecommand.


### 1.2 ROS kinetic

ROS is a software design to control robot. Itâ€™s works with different nodes who
exchange information. I recommended the kinetic version which is the stable
one for working with Librealsense.
You can find how to install ROS in your machine here: [http://wiki.ros.](http://wiki.ros.)
org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu. IalsorecommendtofollowtheROStu-
torial if you are a beginner.

### 1.3 Librealsense

Librealsense is an SDK created to use Intel cameras like the R200 or SR300 and

### 1.4 Verifies installation

Onceyouhavecorrectlyinstalledallthetoolsyoucanverifiesyourinstallation.
First open a terminal, and run the following commands

```
roscore
```
If ROS is setup correctly you will see the core running like this :

You can check the correct installation of realsense by running the following
command with a SR300 plugged in a new terminal.

```
roslaunch realsense_camera sr300_nodelet_rgbd.launch
rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
```

```
and this one in a third terminal.
```
```
rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
```
```
You will a windows with the output of the camera.
```
### 1.5 Using RVIZ to get your first frame

A more complete viewer is available with the classic librealsense installation.
You can use it using the command below.

```
rosrun rviz rviz -d rviz/realsense_rgbd_pointcloud.rviz
```
```
In order to uze RVIZ you will need to do some modification
```
1. change map to camera link
2. in the add windows choose whats you want to display.

## 2 Get and compile the apk

In this section i will show you how to get my code and how to compile it. You
can find the code for using the camera in my github here: https://github.
com/Kebsox/Robot-grasping
First you need to create a catkin space. If you already do that you need to
skips this step.


1. Create catkin

```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
```
```
After that you need to get the code
```
2. Clone repertory

```
git clone https://github.com/Kebsox/Robot-grasping.git
```
```
Youcanfindinthisdirectorythecmakewithcommentstoshowwhatsyou
need to include.
```
3. Build the catkin

```
catkin_init_workspace
cd ..
catkin_make clean
catkin_make
source ./devel/setup.bash
```
```
Normally you should see somethings like
```
```
Linking CXX executable /home/kebsox/catkin_ws/devel/
...lib/projet_victor/main
```
4. Run the software
    Now the final step you have to do is to run this command:ros
       rosrun projet_victor main

## 3 Use the software

If everything went correctly in the previous section you should see two win-
dows.
The first with the image in color and the second the cloud point of the image.
You can save both information by clicking on one of the two images with the
thumbwheel. The images will be saved in the root of the catkin following n
name format. You can start numbering again by deleting the index.txt file that
will have appeared at the root of the catkin.
Then you will be asked if you want to continue shooting or not.
If you want more information the code is fully commented and you can send
me an email at vpj.talbot@gmail.com
